## What did you do ovr the weekend?

### Chris M

1. Couple of things: went to the Moreton Morrel (Warwickshire College) 'Lambing weekend' to see the lambs born and kids get to hold them
2. It was my birthday on Sunday so had a visit from my family and some great presents: mushroom growing kit, records, a bin for the car (in-joke with my daughter), and a coffee/chocs from my son.
